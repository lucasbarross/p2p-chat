All you need to do is execute `python server.py` on command line (assuming your python is on PATH) and connect as many clients you want with `python client.py`. 

On the client, choose your username. After that, if you're going to wait someone to connect with you typing `w`. Else, if you want to connect to someone, type `c`. If you chose to connect, now you need to select the user you want to connect typing his id given by the online users table.
